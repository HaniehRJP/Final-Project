# Final-Project
# Predicting Online Shoppers' Purchase Intentions

## Description
This project focuses on predicting whether online visitors will convert into customers based on their behavior and interactions with the website. Leveraging the "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset," we aim to develop predictive models that can identify potential customers, allowing businesses to optimize marketing strategies and improve conversion rates.

By analyzing features such as administrative pages visited, duration spent on informational pages, product-related pages, bounce rates, and more, our goal is to build robust models that provide actionable insights into users' purchase intentions. This predictive approach enables businesses to make informed decisions, tailor their online strategies, and enhance the overall user experience to drive successful customer conversions.

## Dataset Information
- The dataset used for this project is the "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset."
- It includes features such as administrative pages visited, duration spent on informational pages, product-related pages, bounce rates, and more.
- The target variable is 'Revenue,' indicating whether a visitor made a purchase (1 for Yes, 0 for No).

## Data Exploration and cleaning data
- Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features and the target variable.
- Clean the data Remove typos Correct datatypes
- Check for any imbalances in the target variable.

## Feature Engineering
- Perform any necessary preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values or outliers.
- Encode categorical variables.

## Model Selection
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Applying machine learning algorithms for binary classification.
- Train the selected models on the training set.


## Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the models using relevant metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
- Use cross-validation to ensure robustness.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
- Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms by comparing logistic regression, decision trees, random forests and KNN models


## Add User Input Interface 
- Include input part for end user to input some variables and get the prediction of whether online visitors will convert into customers or not.
